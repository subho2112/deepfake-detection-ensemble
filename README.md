# DeepFake Detection Prototype

## Introduction
Deepfake technology uses AI to generate realistic synthetic media. Detecting such manipulated content is crucial for security, media integrity, and trust. This prototype demonstrates a lightweight yet effective approach to detect deepfake images and videos using two pretrained models from Hugging Face and an ensemble strategy to boost performance.
